Playpen README

This repository will be used to test methods of working with branches to develop apps in collaboration with others.

The Playpen master is located at https://github.com/Hoser00/Playpen.git. The development branch is currently found at http://10.0.0.248/~jpday/sample on the LAN. The production version will be found at http://10.0.0.248/sample. 

The whole point of this exercise is to find out what I'm doing wrong. Scream NOOB all you want.
